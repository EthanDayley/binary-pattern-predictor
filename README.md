# Binary Pattern Predictor

## Purpose
This project aims to produce a biologically inspired neural
network that can recognize and predict patterns in binary
sequences like, for example, **0011001100...** or
**11011101101110...**

It tries to avoid any "magic", relying wholly on the natural 
evolution of the neural network.

## Methodology
Neural network in this project follows the structure 
shown in the image below.
